Community Feedback Process for Zarr Specifications

--------------

ZEP stands for Zarr Enhancement Proposal. A ZEP is a design document
providing information to the Zarr community, describing a modification
or enhancement of the `Zarr
specifications <https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, a new
feature for its processes or environment. The ZEP should provide
specific proposed changes to the Zarr specification and a narrative
rationale for the specification changes.

We intend ZEPs to be the primary mechanism for evolving the spec,
collecting community input on major issues and documenting the design
decision that has gone into Zarr.

ZEP Meetings üßëüèª‚Äçüíª
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We hold bi-weekly ZEPs meetings to propose, discuss, review and finalize
discussions around current ZEPs and Zarr Specification. More info
available here: https://zarr.dev/zeps/meetings/
