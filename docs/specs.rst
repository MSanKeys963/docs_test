Zarr Specification refers to a specification for a chunked, compressed, N-dimensional array format primarily designed for storing large numerical arrays efficiently. It is commonly used in scientific computing and data analysis.

The Zarr format offers benefits such as efficient use of storage, parallel and out-of-core processing capabilities, and compatibility with various scientific computing libraries such as NumPy, Dask, and Xarray.

The specification defines how data should be organized within a Zarr store, including details on chunking, compression, metadata, and other attributes necessary for efficient storage and retrieval of array data. This specification helps ensure interoperability between different software implementations that support the Zarr format.
